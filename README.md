# Ajuna-Citizens

Game Design Proposal for Ajuna Citizens

Vision and Goals: Befriending Learning: Education by Gaming, Storytelling to onboard community members on Ajuna for Social Welfare

Goals: We wish to also create an open source community game to onboard users, designers, curators and developers to Ajuna network. Matching community and environment incentives along with gamification is an engaging strategy for outreach, marketing and education and enable faster user onboarding.

We propose to improve upon the existing ways of imparting education in Ajuna eco-system by incorporating a fun-based learning game, Ajuna Citizens, which is an open-source Web3 software activity. This game involves inculcating community leadership skills and removing the learning differences that might arise due to Ajuna users belonging to different age groups, ethnic backgrounds, cultures and economic backgrounds. Ajuna Citizens involve optimization of resources of a town, while taking appropriate steps to ensure the common welfare. A curriculum can further be integrated into the various tasks.
